REFLECTIONS:

// PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE INCLUDED MY WIREFRAME AND DATABASE SCHEMA IN THE PUBLIC FOLDER.

// What have I have achieved? I feel like some of my understanding of some aspects of the coding is getting a little better in terms of concept, some of the syntax, as well as imports, functions and some logic. That said I had tremendous trouble retrieving data from Supabase and could not acheive any results viewing this in my local server using Thunderclient. I actually started the whole project from scratch again after several hours spent trying to debug. This however didn't result in success - in fact the only success in the Thunderclient was receiving my Error message!!

// I followed through the various steps with the workshop demos and this is taking me alot of time as not everything is sinking in. I just don't seem to be able to bring all of the aspects of the workshops into a cohesive manner.

// I'm sorry that I haven't rendered the project as I had the issue with the server requests from Supabase.

// I feel like I am on repeat with my weekly assignments and not completing them, so its difficult to feel motivated currently.

Planning:

Advice from Manny:

1. Plan my wireframe - what does my app look like from the user perspective. Use OKSO app.

2. Plan my database schema - use DRAWSQL or Figma EML tool

- what data do i need to store?
- based on the data how many tables do i need to organise my data efficiently?
- If I have more than one table, - so two or more tables- what is the relationship between them? This is a strecth goal and would need junction tables.
- If have two or more tables - how do i connect the tables - foriegn keys/junction tables..

3. Set up tables in database in Supabase

   - Create a project (database)
   - use the SQL editor to create my tables and insert seed data
   - If i use the sql editor in supabase i copy the file over to a seed.js file on the 'server' in terminal so Manny and Joe can see them as they don't have access to my Supabase - make a note that i used the sql editor

4. Set up the server

5. ## Set up the client
